[Culture Docs: Facebook, Netflix and Valve](https://bytepawn.com/culture-docs-facebook-netflix-and-valve.html)

Facebook is the best company I ever worked at, mostly because of its awesome mission and impact oriented culture. This is reflected in the Culture Doc, which is easily the best of the three — but, I'm definitely biased. There are many principles (such Move Fast and Break Things) and mental models (such as the Perception vs Reality plot, which I can't find online unfortunately) that I learned at Facebook and I still refer to on a daily basis.

Facebook's Culture Doc is produced by the Facebook Analog Research Laboratory, a little team within the company responsible for making posters and booklets and other analog materials for employees and the office. Fortunately, Ben Barry, who created the booklet, has put a few scans online. All the images below are from his site.

Thinking along the Vision—Mission—Strategy—Tactics—Execution spectrum, Facebook's Culture Doc focuses on Mission and Execution.

Unfortunately most pages of the booklet are not available scanned, but in some cases the same message is available in scanned poster form:

## Netflix

The Netflix Culture Doc started out as a [deck of 100+ slides](https://bytepawn.com/images/netflix_culture.pdf), but over time it has become a minisite on the official Netflix website: jobs.netflix.com/culture.

Unlike Facebook's, which focuses on mission and execution, this feels more like a set of HR principles. However, there are many gems. Here are some of my favorite (from the 2012 version):

> The real company values, as opposed to the nice-sounding values, are shown by who gets rewarded, promoted, or let go.

> Netflix wants to work with people who embody these 9 values: judgement, communication, impact, curiosity, innovation, courage, passion, honesty, selflessness.

> Context, not control: If you want to build a ship, don't drum up the people to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.
